# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order.
# Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl', 'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# Solution: names is set type and therefore an unordered collection hence
# print function will not necessarily output in alphabetical order but instead
# is arbitrary.
