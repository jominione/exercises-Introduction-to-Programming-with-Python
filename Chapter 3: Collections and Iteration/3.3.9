# Write a function that computes and returns the factorial of a number by
# using a for or while loop. The factorial of a positive integer n, signified
# by n!, is defined as the product of all integers between 1 and n, inclusive:

# You may assume that the argument is always a positive integer.

# Solution:

def factorial(integer):
    product = 1
    for index in range(1, integer+1):
        product *= index
    return product

print(factorial(1))     # 1
print(factorial(2))     # 2
print(factorial(3))     # 6
print(factorial(4))     # 24
print(factorial(5))     # 120
print(factorial(6))     # 720
print(factorial(7))     # 5040
print(factorial(8))     # 40320
print(factorial(25))    # 15511210043330985984000000
