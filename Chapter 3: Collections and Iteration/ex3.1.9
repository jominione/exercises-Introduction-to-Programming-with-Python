# Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list equal? Yes. Both lists have same elements.
# Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list the same object? No. The list constructor creates a new object.
# Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list equal? Yes. Both nested lists have same elements.
# Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list the same object? Yes.
# list contstructor creates a shallow copy of the iterable passed as an argument.
# Shallow copies don't crate new nested lists. Instead, only a reference to the nested list gets copied.
