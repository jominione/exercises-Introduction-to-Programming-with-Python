# Explain why the code below prints different values on lines 3 and 4.

text = "It's probably pining for the fjords!"

print(text[21:35].rfind('f'))   # 8
print(text.rfind('f', 21, 35))  # 29

# Solution:

# The expression on line 5 first substrings of text and applies rfind to
# find the index of first instance of 'f' in the substring.
# The expression on line 6 applies rfind to the find the index of first 
# instance of 'f' starting from index 21 of the whole string.
