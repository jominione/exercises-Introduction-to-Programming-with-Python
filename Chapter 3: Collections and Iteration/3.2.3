# Write Python code to create a new tuple from (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The new
# tuple sould be in reverse order from the original. It should also exclude
# the first and last members of the original.

# The result should be the tuple (4, 3, 2).

# Solution:

tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
list = list(reversed(tuple))
new_tuple = tuple(list[1:4])
print(list)
