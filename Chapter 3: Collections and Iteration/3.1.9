# Given the code below:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]]
another_list = list(my_list)

# Answer the following questions and explain your answers:
# 1. Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list equal?
# 2. Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list the same object?
# 3. Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list equal?
# 4. Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list the same
# object?

# Don't write any code for this exericse.

# Solution:
# 1. Since my_list is assigned to another_list they are equal in value.
# 2. They are not equal because list constructor creates a new object.
# 3. The nested lists at index 3 are equal because they are the same value.
# 4. They are the same object because list creates a shallow copy and hence
# index 3 points to the same object.
