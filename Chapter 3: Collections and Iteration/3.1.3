# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at
# least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

# Solution:
# Differences:
# - Lists are mutable while tuples are not.
# - Lists use [] while tuples use ().
# Similarities:
# - Both can use constructors to create object.
# - Both are heterogenous, that is, can contain different object types.
