# Let's try another variation on the even/odd-numbers theme.

# We'll return to the simpler one-dimensional version of my_list. In this
# problem, you should write code that creates a new list with one element
# each number in my_list. If the original number is an even, then the
# correspondent element in the new list should contain the string 'even';
# otherwise, the element should contain 'odd'.

my_list = [
    1, 3, 6, 11,
    4, 2, 4, 9,
    17, 16, 0,
]

# Solution:

result = [ 'even' if number % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for number in my_list ]    
print(result)
