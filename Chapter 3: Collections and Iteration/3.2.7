# Write Python code to replace all the : characters in the string below
# with +.

info = 'xyz:*:42:42:Lee Kim:/home/xyz:/bin/zsh'

# Try this problem using the methods you've learned about in this chapter.
# Once you have that working, use the Python documentation for the str type
# to find an alternative solution.

# Solution:

split_info = info.split(':')
join_info = '+'.join(split_info)
print(join_info)

# Alternative Solution:

info2 = 'xyz:*:42:42:Lee Kim:/home/xyz:/bin/zsh'

new_info2 = info2.replace(':', '+')
print(new_info2)
