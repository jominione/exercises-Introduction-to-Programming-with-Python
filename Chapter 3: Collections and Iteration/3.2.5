# Which of the following values can't be used as a key in a dict object,
# and why?

'cat'
(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2)
['a', 'b']
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
range(5)
{1, 4, 9, 16, 25}
3
0.0
frozenset({1, 4, 9, 16, 25})

# Solution:

# List on line 6, dictionary on line 7, set on line 9 can't be used as keys 
# because keys must be immutable. Since lists and dictionaries are mutable 
# objects they are not valid keys for dictionaries.
