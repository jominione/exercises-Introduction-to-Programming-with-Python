# Can you write some code to change the value 'bye' in the following tuple
# to 'goodbye'?

stuff = ('hello', 'world', 'bye', 'now)

# Note: this problem is a bit tricky.

# Solution: Since tuple is immutable you reassign stuff with new tuple object
# that includes the value 'goodbye'.

stuff = ('hello', 'world', 'goodbye', 'now)
