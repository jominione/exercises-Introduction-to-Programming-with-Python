# Without running this code, what will it print? Why?

dict1 = {
    "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy": 42,
    'Monty Python': 'The Life of Brian',
    'Airplane!': "Don't call me Shirley!",
}

dict2 = dict(dict1)
dict2['Monty Python'] = 'Holy Grail'
print(dict1['Monty Python'])

# Solution: 'The Life of Brian'. Line 9 you are creating a new variable 
# by making a shallow copy of dict1. The object dict2 is not the same object
# as dict1. When you change the value of 'Monty Python' key in dict2 this
# won't change in dict1.
