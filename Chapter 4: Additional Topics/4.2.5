# On reflection, we've decided that we don't want to rely on using a global
# variable in the code we wrote in the previous example. To fix this, we're
# going to nest the code from the previous example into an outer function:

def all_actions():
    counter = 0

    def increment_counter():
        nonlocal counter
        counter += 1
    
    print(counter)

    increment_counter()
    printer(counter)

    increment_counter()
    printer(counter)

    counter = 100
    increment_counter()
    printer(counter)

all_actions()
