# Without running this code, what will it print? Why?

dict1 = {
    'a': [1, 2, 3],
    'b': (4, 5, 6),
}

dict2 = dict(dict1)
dict1['a'][1] = 42
print(dict2['a'])

# Solution: [1, 42, 3]. dict2 is a new object that is shallow copy of dict1.
# Since 'a' points to a list object, mutating the value of 'a' in dict1 
# will be reflected in dict2 because value 'a' also points to the same list
# object as dict1.
