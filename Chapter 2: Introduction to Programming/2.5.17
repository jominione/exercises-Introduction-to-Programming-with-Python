# Which of the identifers in the following program are function names? Which
# are method names? Which are built-in functions?

def say(message):
    print(f'==> {message}')

string1 = input()
string2 = input()

say(max(string1.upper(), string2.lower()))

# Solution:

# | Category           | names             |
# |--------------------|-------------------|
# | functions          | say               |
# | methods            | upper, lower      |
# | built-in functions | print, input, max |
