# Write a function that takes a single integer argument and prints a message
# that describes whether:
# - the value is between 0 and 50 (inclusive)
# - the value is between 51 and 100 (inclusive)
# - the value is greater than 100
# - the value is less than 0

# Solution:

def number_range(int):
    if int < 0:
        print(f'{int} is less than 0')
    elif int <= 50:
        print(f'{int} is between 0 and 50')
    elif int <= 100:
        print(f'{int} is between 51 and 100')
    else:
        print(f'{int} is greater than 100')
