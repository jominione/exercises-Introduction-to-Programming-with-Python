# Take a look at this code snippet:

foo = 'bar'

def set_foo():
    foo = 'qux'

set_foo()
print(foo)

# What does this program print? Why?

# Solution: Program prints 'bar'. When you invoke set_foo it reassigns foo with
# 'qux' but this variable isn't available when executing code that isn't part of
# that function.
# The print function searches the global namespace for foo.
