# Without running the following code, what do you think it will do?

def foo(first, second=3, third=2):
    print(first)
    print(second)
    print(third)

foo(42, 3.141592)

# Solution: Will print 42\n3.141592\n2. Will print the first two arguments
# that is passed to it then uses default value for the last argument.
