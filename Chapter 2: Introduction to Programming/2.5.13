# Without running the following code, what do you think it will do?

def foo(first, second=3, third):
    print(first)
    print(second)
    print(third)

foo(42)

# Solution: Will raise SyntaxError because foo is defined incorrectly.
# foo defined with three arguments with second a default value. Python
# requires functions to have all subsequent parameters to first parameter
# in function to be defined with default value also have default values.
