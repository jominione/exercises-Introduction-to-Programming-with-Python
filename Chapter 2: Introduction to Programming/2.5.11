# Without running the following code, what do you think it will do?

def foo(first, second=3, third=2):
    print(first)
    print(second)
    print(third)

foo(42)

# Solution: Will print 42\n3\n2. Since foo is defined with three parameters
# with last two parameters set to default values. And passed function with
# one argument so Python will use default values for the last two parameters.
