# Assume that obj already has a value of 42 when the code below starts running.
# Which of the subsequent statements reassign the variable? Which statements
# mutate the value of the object that obj references? Which statements do
# neither? If necessary, you can read the documentation.

# Solution:

obj = 'ABcd'        # Reassign to string
obj.upper()         # Neither
obj = obj.lower()   # Reassign to new string object
print(len(obj))     # Neither
obj = list(obj)     # Reassign to new list object
obj.pop()           # Mutation
obj[2] = 'X'        # Mutation
obj.sort()          # Mutation
set(obj)            # Neither
obj = tuple(obj)    # Reassign
