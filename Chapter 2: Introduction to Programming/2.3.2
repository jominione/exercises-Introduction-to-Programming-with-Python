# Classify the following potential function names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic,
# or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.

# | Name          |
# | --------------|
# | index         |
# | CatName       |
# | lazy_dog      |
# | quick_Fox     |
# | 1stCharacter  |
# | operand2      |
# | BIG_NUMBER    |
# | \pi           |

# Solution: Since function names in Python follow the same conventions as
# variable names, the answer to this question is the same as the previous
# question.
